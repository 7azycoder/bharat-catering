#Bharat Catering Localhost Website
This was a simple localhost website made for a local catering firm. They wanted to book their orders from computer. I made them a website that had a list of menus and details. The owners could add items to and order and remove them also. Later on they can take a printout of the complete order in a fixed format. I used material design for front end design and back end was implemented in php.
